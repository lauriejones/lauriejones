### Hey I'm **Laurie Jones** &mdash; front&ndash;end developer and designer based in Newcastle, Australia.

Professionally happiest at the intersection of UX and UI. Passionate about enabling teams to build consistent, high-quality and inclusive user interfaces.

Design systems are my JAM. Stack components FTW. Make components more reusable and composable. Constantly making breaking changes.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the [**Mesh Design System**](https://www.meshdesignsystem.com/)
